👋 Hi, I’m "Salih Öztürk," a 19-year-old student studying Computer Programming at Akdeniz University. I have previously taken many courses and earned certificates related to computers, but those trainings were focused on Computer Networks. Now, I am diving into software.

👀 My interests include Sports, Music, Trade, Entrepreneurship, and Computers.

🌱 To me, the countless opportunities offered by the digital world are a perfect chance for self-improvement. With the knowledge I've gained in software, network, and web design, I strive to understand and solve the complexities of the digital world.

💞️ I am quite open to collaboration and teamwork. Coming together in the business world and projects, drawing strength from different perspectives, is an undeniable way for me to meet and understand new people and ideas.
